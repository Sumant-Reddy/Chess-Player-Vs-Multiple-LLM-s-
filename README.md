# Chess Player vs Multiple LLMs

A sophisticated chess game that allows players to compete against various AI language models including GPT-4, Gemini, Cohere, and Deepseek. This project combines traditional chess gameplay with state-of-the-art AI capabilities.

## Features

- Play chess against multiple AI language models:
  - OpenAI's GPT-4
  - Google's Gemini
  - Cohere
  - Deepseek
- Beautiful and intuitive user interface
- Real-time move validation
- Game history tracking
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Save and load game states

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (install via pip):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- API keys for:
  - OpenAI (for GPT-4)
  - Google AI (for Gemini)
  - Cohere
  - Deepseek

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sumant-Reddy/Chess-Player-Vs-Multiple-LLM-s-.git
   cd Chess-Player-Vs-Multiple-LLM-s-
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file and add your API keys
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key
   COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_key
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Select your opponent (GPT-4, Gemini, Cohere, or Deepseek)

3. Choose the game settings:
   - Difficulty level
   - Time control (if applicable)
   - Board orientation

4. Play your moves using the graphical interface
